1. What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
   DevOps and cloud engineer doesn't make a much difference in the work in IT industry. Devops provides cloud enginners to work for a separate task while other cloud enginners who are adminitrating the cloud services are also cloud engineers.

2. Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
   I am working in IT since last 4 years started my career as oracle dba and now in build team.
   Which is basically a team which validates servers built from devops pipeline, from there I got a chance to think on devops and started to take deep dive into devops with help of this course.
   Now with growing tech cloud is the new gold of IT and exploring this will be opening ways in IT to survive.
   
4. Where do you want to reach?
   I want to mould myself in devops enginner as got bored with same repeating tasks of validating servers and grow with better package and better surrounding in IT.
   After some months I can represent my self a good engineer in market. 

5. How you will stay consistent every single day ?
   I will try to get more hands on new environments of devops like git,github, docker, k8, and gen-AI.
   Will atleast try to run one new command each day which relates to devops and gradually increasing it with increasing pace.
   I will be watching tutorials as per course even prevoius recording if I am not in a position to do handson.

I will be trying to do so in upcoming 90 days, Looking to cover up this backlog of daily tasks to complete ASAP.
Seems i am afraid of commitments but this git will motivate me to commit many thing as wihtout commit there is no value of my work.

Fingers crossed. :)
#DAY1 as devops.
